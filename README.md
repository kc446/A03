<i><u>How to Use Git</u></i>

0-1. create an account for a class you took several years ago<br>
0-2. use it once, and only once, in those several years<br>
0-3. take a class where you actually NEED to use it<br>
0-4. dust off the cobwebs

1 (REAL). create a <b>repository</b>; it's like an online "project" folder
2. copy the repository to your local network/computer -- this is called <b>cloning</b>
   - apparently github has a desktop app so you can use that to clone it but not to edit it
3. open the repository in webstorm (you can do this directly from the desktop app)
4. change and add files in the repository as you will (these changes are called **commits**)
5. <b>push</b> your commits to github, either as a <b>commit</b> or a <b>branch</b> of the central repository (the latter requires starting a <b>pull</b> request)

<i><u>Glossary</u></i>

- **GIT** - a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency (description on official website, https://git-scm.com/)
- **GitHub** - the website where central git repositories are stored, shared, and distributed -- you're already here
- **Repository** - essentially a Git/Github project, sometimes shortened to "repo"
- **Remote** - connections to other repositories, sort of like a bookmark only it uses an alias to reference them rather than linking to them directly
- **Commit** - a package of changes made to a file in a repository
- **Push** - sending a commit to Github 
- **Branch** - a deviation of an existing repository
- **Clone** - a duplicate of an existing repository that is downloaded to your local system
- **Fork** - an edited clone of an existing repository
- **Pull** - updating an existing repository to match a remote repo, usually you need to make a pull request to do that
- **Merge** - integrating a branch into the main repository
- **Merge Conflict** - issues when merging
- **Fetch** - downloading a remote repo into an existing repo
